**Kotlin Course Tasks**

**Session 1**

**Lab 1**

1. Use `readLine()` to read input from the user.
    
    - The user should enter their name.
        
    - If the user enters an empty string, store a default value.
        
    - Use an `if` expression to define a greeting message based on whether the user entered a name.
        
2. Create an array of integers.
    
    - Use `Random` to fill the array with 100 random numbers between 1 and 100.
        
    - Iterate through the collection and print values that are less than or equal to 10.
        
3. Calculator:
    
    - ADD
        
    - SUB
        
    - MUL
        
    - DIV
