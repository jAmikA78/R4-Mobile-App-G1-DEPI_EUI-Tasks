# R4 Mobile App G1 DEPI_EUI Task

## Hey Team, Let's Get Started!

- **Group ID**: R4 Mobile App G1 DEPI_EUI
- **Instructor**: Eng. Ahmed Ali
- **What's This Repo For?**: This is your space to submit session tasks! The main branch is just for this README and course resources. All your awesome work goes on your own branches.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Students

1. **Heads Up on the Main Branch**: Please don't push directly to the main branch – it's reserved for course info and instructions. Let's keep it clean!

2. **Set Up Your Own Branch**: Time to create your personal workspace!

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jamika78/R4-Mobile-App-G1-DEPI_EUI-Tasks.git
   cd R4-Mobile-App-G1-DEPI_EUI
   git checkout -b student-your-name
   ```

3. **Work on Your Branch**: Add your session tasks and files to a folder named after the session (like `./session-01/`). Here's a handy example structure to get you started:

     ```bash
     session-01/
     ├── task1/
     │   ├── MainActivity.java
     │   ├── app.apk
     │   └── screenshots/
     │       ├── screenshot1.png
     │       └── screenshot2.png
     └── README.md
     session-02/
     ├── task1/
     │   ├── MainActivity.java
     │   ├── app.apk
     │   └── screenshots/
     │       ├── screenshot1.png
     │       └── screenshot2.png
     ├── task2/
     │   └──  MainActivity.java
     └── README.md
     ```

   Once you're ready, commit your changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added session 1 tasks"
     ```

4. **Push Your Branch**: Share your work with the world!

   ```bash
   git push origin student-your-name
   ```

5. **Submit Your Work**: Great job! Once it's pushed, let Eng. Ahmed Ali know. If you need to make changes, just keep committing and pushing to your branch.

6. **Best Practices to Shine**: 
   - Keep your commits clear and focused (small changes are best).
   - **Don't merge your branch into main**.
